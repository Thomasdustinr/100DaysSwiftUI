This day wrapped up functions. I learned how to write default values for parameters, how to deal with errors, and I had a 4th Checkpoint exercise. After trying to complete the Checkpoint for a while, I gave up and got the answer. I had a couple lines correct, but I didn't know what I was doing after that. After looking at the answer, I realized it was much simpler than I was making it out to be. I just thought too hard and overcomplicated the code. I can't lie, these recent lessons have been confusing and Iâ€™ve forgotten how to write certain blocks. I have doubts if this is the correct path for me. I know that I need to push through and stick with it longer but it's just frustrating not be able to complete "easy" assigments. I'm not going to give up...
