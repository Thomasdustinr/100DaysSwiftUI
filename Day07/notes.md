 I can't lie, I should be on day 8 today but I let time slip by yesterday. I won't let that happen again. Today I learned about reusing functions, how to return 1 and more than 1 value from a function. I also learned how to customize parameter labels. The most interesting thing I learned today was about tuples. I need to review this section again, because I got confused on a few things.
