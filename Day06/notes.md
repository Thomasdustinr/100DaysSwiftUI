Another packed learning day. I learned about for loops, while loops, how to use “break” and “continue” in a loop, and I had Checkpoint 3. Everything was pretty easy to understand. I found the “break” and “continue” lesson to be the most interesting. I almost completed Checkpoint 3 on my first attempt. I wrote the correct code but had it backwards. I wrote the (if i.isMultiple(of: number3) && i.isMultiple(of: number5) condition after the individual checks, instead of it being first. I also forgot to include else if statements after the first if statement. After some hints, I wrote the correct code on my second attempt. Overall, not bad for my 6th day.
