Although this day was short, it got a little confusing. There are a few ways to write type annotations so after trying to memorize them all, I couldn't remember how to write a single one once I got to the practice part. In today's lesson there was a second Checkpoint assignment involving arrays and sets. I got the array part right but forgot how to write a set. Overall, I need to review this section (day 3 and 4) again to get a better understanding of how to write certain type annotations.
